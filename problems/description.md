The Strassen algorithm is an algorithm for matrix multiplication. It is faster than the standard matrix multiplication algorithm and is useful in practice for large matrices, but would be slower than the fastest known algorithms for extremely large matrices. Strassen's algorithm works for any ring, such as plus/multiply, but not all semirings, such as min-plus or boolean algebra, where the naive algorithm still works, and so called combinatorial matrix multiplication. The standard matrix multiplication takes approximately 2N3 (where N = 2n) arithmetic operations (additions and multiplications); the asymptotic complexity is **Θ(N3)**.

The number of additions and multiplications required in the Strassen algorithm can be calculated as follows: let f(n) be the number of operations for a *2n × 2n matrix*. Then by recursive application of the Strassen algorithm, we see that *f(n) = 7f(n−1) + ℓ4n*, for some constant *ℓ* that depends on the number of additions performed at each application of the algorithm.
