    "array": "An array data structure, or simply an array, is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements (values or variables), each identified by at least one array index or key.",
    
    "stack": "A stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two principal operations: push, which adds an element to the collection, and pop, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet remove.",

    "queue": "A queue is an abstract data type or collection in which the entities are kept in order and the principal operations on the collection are the addition of entities to the rear terminal position.",

    "linkedlist": "A linked list is a linear collection of data elements, whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence.",

    "trees": "A tree is a widely used abstract data type (ADT)—or data structure implementing this ADT—that simulates a hierarchical tree structure, with a root value and subtrees of children with a parent node, represented as a set of linked nodes.",

    "graphs": "A graph is an abstract data type that is meant to implement the undirected graph and directed graph concepts from mathematics, specifically the field of graph theory.",

    "searching": "A search algorithm is any algorithm which solves the search problem, namely, to retrieve information stored within some data structure, or calculated in the search space of a problem domain.",

    "sorting": "A sorting algorithm is an algorithm that puts elements of a list in a certain order. The most frequently used orders are numerical order and lexicographical order. Efficient sorting is important for optimizing the efficiency of other algorithms which require input data to be in sorted list.",

    "miscellaneous": "Contains a number of miscellaneous questions that are usually asked during an ibnterview. This link may contain questions qhich uses more than one data structure or some complex problems.",

    "hash-table": "A hash table (hash map) is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values."
